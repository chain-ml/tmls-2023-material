If a transaction exceeds senior management\u2019s authorities, the approval of the Risk Committee of the Board is  required.    \nProduct approval  \nProposals for credit products and services are comprehensively reviewed and approved under a risk assessment framework  and are subject to risk approval authorities which increase as the level of risk increases. New and amended products must  be reviewed relative to all risk drivers, including credit risk. All existing products must be reviewed following a risk-based  \nassessment approach on a regular basis.  \nCredit risk limits  \n\u0081 The allocation of risk appetite and Board delegated authorities are supported by the establishment of risk limits which  \ntake into account both regulatory constraints and internal risk management judgment. Risk limits are established at the  following levels: single name limits, regional, country and industrial sector limits (notional and economic capital),  regulatory large exposure limits, product and portfolio limits, and underwriting and distribution risk limits. These limits  apply across all businesses, portfolios, transactions and products.", "metadata": {"page_number": 72, "source": "data/RBC_2022_AR.pdf"}}
