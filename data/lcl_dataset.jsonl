Retail segment sales grew 9.7% reflecting strong growth in both Food and Drug businesses. Drug Retail sales growth was driven by continued strong demand for cough and cold products and strength in high margin beauty and cosmetics categories. Food Retail sales reflected the Company\u2019s efforts to provide value to its customers. The Company\u2019s Discount stores outperformed, benefiting from an increased consumer focus on price. Market stores extended strong performance relative to peers with impactful promotional strategies. Gross margins were slightly lower, largely related to the no\u00a0name\u00ae price freeze and increased commitment to promotional activity, partially offset by continued strength in higher margin front-store sales in the Drug business. Higher sales and leverage from focused cost control measures drove earnings growth in the quarter. \n2022 Annual Report - Financial Review   Loblaw Companies Limited 29", "metadata": {"page_number": 49, "source": "data/LCL_2022_AR.pdf"}}
